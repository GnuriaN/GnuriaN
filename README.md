### I'm Ruslan Prokhorov

and I'm anykey... I love Python. 

Information technology is not a job. This is a style of life, it's when you learn what you like and what brings pleasure, always and everywhere. Now I am developing automated tests on Python and studying everything related to testing and auto-test.
Previously, I was engaged in the creation and maintenance of its infrastructure in small companies. I had to create the infrastructure from scratch, had to maintain the existing one, as well as to make modernization. My area of interest also includes information security.

I have the feeling that HR specialists do not see the following line:
[Attention is valid until 01.06.2022 (you snooze, you lose)] I am not currently looking for a new job. Thanks for not bothering me.

P.S. I don't like to rivet the code for test cases. I like to automate the testing process. Integration of one program with another. Creating tools and utilities. Creating test stand.
