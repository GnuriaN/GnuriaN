### I'm Ruslan Prokhorov

and I'm anykey...

Information technology is not a job. This is a style of life, it's when you learn what you like and what brings pleasure, always and everywhere. Now I am developing automated tests on Python and studying everything related to testing and auto-test.
Previously, I was engaged in the creation and maintenance of its infrastructure in small companies. I had to create the infrastructure from scratch, had to maintain the existing one, as well as to make modernization. My area of interest also includes information security.
